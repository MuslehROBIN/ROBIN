in the constellation QN34.</i>

532
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,836
- Was?
<i>- Yes.</i>

533
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:42,214
<i>The planet no longer exists,
and hasn't for 30 years.</i>

534
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:43,956
Let's see what it looked like.

535
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:44,884
- [keyboard clacking]
- [beeping]

536
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,135
<i>Abundant vegetation,</i>

537
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,430
<i>a few primal species,
but of no particular interest.</i>

538
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,225
The one in my dream
was pretty... interesting.

539
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,476
Zoom in.

540
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,940
- Use our access codes.
<i>- I'm afraid that won't be enough, Major.</i>

541
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,483
<i>Access is restricted.</i>

542
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:02,775
To what rank?

543
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,112
<i>General. Five stars.</i>

544
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,201
The creature in my dream, she had a pearl
just like that on her neck.

545
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,285
<i>Noted, Major.</i>

546
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:15,706
<i>Leaving exospace in one minute.</i>

547
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,168
He's very cute, you know.
And a real charmer.

548
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:20,836
You may have some competition.

549
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,255
[chuckles]
I'm fine with competition.

550
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,258
[beeping]

551
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,218
Hey, I'm still waiting for your answer.

552
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:33,682
I know I can be full of myself sometimes,
but I'm dead serious about my proposal.

553
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,726
We have to complete the mission, Major.

554
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,853
There's still the top secret
part to attend to.

555
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,397
Or is your perfect memory
failing you again?

556
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,190
[Alex] <i>Seat belt.</i>

557
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,735
You know what?

558
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,864
I'm gonna ask for 10 days'
leave right now,

559
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,828
and I'm gonna take you to the most
beautiful beach in the whole universe.

560
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,078
- A real beach this time.
- [chuckles]

561
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,206
The perfect place for a honeymoon.

562
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,834
- [Alex] <i>Ten seconds.</i>
- The honeymoon comes after the wedding.

563
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:01,918
You know that, right?

564
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,713
- Really?
- Yup.

565
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:08,217
[Alex] <i>Three, two, one. Decelerating.</i>

566
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,762
[Valerian] Whoa!

567
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,305
Alex, what are you doing?

568
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,391
[Alex] <i>Sorry, too much traffic.</i>

569
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:19,061
- Do you want me to drive?
- Nope. No, no. No, thank you.

570
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:27,945
[Alex] <i>Welcome to Alpha,</i>

571
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,155
<i>the City of a Thousand Planets.</i>

572
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,450
[beeping]

573
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,119
Alex, can you update us?

574
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,412
[Alex] <i>I'd be delighted to.</i>

575
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:39,665
<i>The Alpha Station has grown 7% this year,</i>

576
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:45,587
<i>and since it left the terrestrial orbit,
it has traveled almost 700 million miles.</i>

577
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:48,340
Population?

578
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:52,720
<i>Almost 30 million. 3,236 species</i>

579
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:55,222
<i>from the four corners
of the universe live on board,</i>

580
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,433
<i>pooling their knowledge and cultures.</i>

581
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,646
<i>Over 5,000 languages spoken, not counting
the various computer languages.</i>

582
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,147
Demographics?

583
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,275
<i>To the south are the submerged parts,</i>

584
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,611
<i>with 800 species living
in all kinds of liquids.</i>

585
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,240
<i>Such as the peaceful Poulong farmers
who grow cobalt.</i>

586
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:18,662
<i>To the north, we have gaseous lands
dominated by the Azin Mö,</i>

587
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:21,290
<i>whose extreme sensitivity
makes them specialists</i>

588
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:24,334
<i>in neurosciences and molecular components.</i>

589
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,587
<i>They can build cells of any kind.</i>

590
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,049
<i>To the east of them,
the large colony of Omelites.</i>

591
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:34,011
<i>They control information technology,
finance, and banking.</i>

592
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,681
<i>Finally, to the west,
in a pressurized atmosphere,</i>

593
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:40,809
<i>we have 9 million humans
and compatible species.</i>

594
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:41,893
Home sweet home.

595
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,438
<i>The economy has been
in shambles for a year.</i>

596
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:48,525
<i>- Do you want a quick summary?</i>
- No. That's enough excitement for one day.

597
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,742
Intruder XB982.

598
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,744
Authorization to dock in Section 1.

599
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,370
- VIP access.
- Oh.

600
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,498
We're famous.
[chuckles]

601
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:20,617
[General Okto-Bar] You're late, Major.

602
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:23,560
Sorry, sir. Things got a bit
more complicated than we expected.

603
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,872
Prepare for the worst
and you won't be disappointed.

604
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:26,897
And neither will I.

605
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,400
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

606
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,655
And you, have you checked the Converter?

607
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:35,948
He's in great shape.

608
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,199
May I ask what's going on?

609
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,492
Follow me.

610
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:45,290
- Declassify.
- [beeps]

611
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,712
A year ago, we discovered
a radioactive zone

612
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,339
right in the middle of the station.

613
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,134
No signal of any kind
could get through it.

614
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,427
We sent several probes, none came back.

615
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,888
So we sent in a special unit.

616
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,599
<i>Its mission was to get as close
to the zone as possible,</i>

617
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,852
and define the nature of the threat.

618
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,229
- And?
- [sighs]

619
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,438
No one came back alive.

620
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,650
- Any idea who attacked them?
- No.

621
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:14,361
This is the situation today.

622
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,154
[beeping]

623
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,075
The air in the zone is unbreathable,
highly contaminated.

624
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:24,037
And it continues to grow. Like a tumor.

625
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,540
A tumor we have to cut out
as soon as we can.

626
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,500
If we don't, and this cancer
keeps spreading,

627
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,377
it will destroy Alpha in less than a week.

628
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,290
Commander, who would have
any reason to destroy Alpha?

629
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,418
Practically every living
species is represented here.

630
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,653
This is a weapon of mass destruction, and
behind every weapon, there is a killer.

631
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:42,264
It doesn't matter who it is. It's a threat
to us all. It must be eliminated.

632
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,347
Through here.

633
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:52,274
<i>- Commander.</i>
- Minister.

634
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,037
<i>The Council has given you the green light.</i>

635
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:57,154
<i>But we strongly recommend
that international law</i>

636
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,674
<i>and the civil rights
of all concerned should be respected.</i>

637
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,408
Of course. I shall see to it personally.

638
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,660
<i>Agents Valerian and Laureline
will be responsible</i>

639
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,912
<i>for your personal protection.</i>

640
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,788
Sir, that won't be necessary.

641
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,416
I have a unit of K-tron
that I personally trained...

642
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,710
<i>It's a direct order from
the government, Commander.</i>

643
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:15,088
<i>The two agents need to report
on the outcome of the operations.</i>

644
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:18,925
As you wish.

645
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,262
<i>Gentlemen, lady, good luck.</i>

646
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,619
Since we have to be on the same team,

647
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:29,686
you mind giving us an update
on the operation?

648
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,023
I'll be speaking to the Security Council
in a few minutes.

649
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:35,651
You'll have all the details
you need to know.

650
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,655
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

651
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,115
[woman speaking Mandarin over P.A.]

652
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,793
Hey, handsome.
You're looking a lot better.

653
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,380
You know, I remember learning
about you guys at school.

654
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,133
I'm dying to find out
if what they say is true.

655
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:02,468
Okay.

656
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:09,976
Wow.

657
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,896
I need to take you shopping with me.

658
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,740
- Wait for me here.
- [door opens]

659
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,325
[yells]

660
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,203
[monitors beeping]

661
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,174
- Anything?
- Not yet.

662
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:44,845
We haven't got a peep out of him,
but I'm trying something new.

663
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,058
[gasps]

664
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,184
One more hour.

665
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:55,063
If he hasn't talked, finish him off.

666
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes, sir.

667
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,910
If anything goes wrong
with this operation,

668
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,790
- you know what you have to do.
- [robot language]

669
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,641
- [chirping]
- Wow.

670
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:35,228
Looks like you're taking
my protection very seriously.

671
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:37,439
His protection, actually.
He's one of a kind.

672
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,334
You're sure he needs to come along
on such a dangerous mission?

673
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,485
The Mül Converter is capable
of reproducing

674
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,321
any conceivable product in record time.

675
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,632
It will come in very handy
if we have to negotiate.

676
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,217
With the army of K-trons
under your command,

677
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,910
I'm surprised negotiating's on the table.

678
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,954
You take care of my security, Major.

679
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,749
I'll take care of any negotiations.

680
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,852
- Give it to me.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

681
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,337
For your personal security,
why don't you let Agent Laureline

682
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,100
look after the little guy for safekeeping?

683
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,841
I don't think so, Major.
It's against protocol.

684
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,093
I am the highest ranking...

685
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,553
That animal is the last living specimen
of its species.

686
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,930
The whole universe is after it.

687
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:12,265
That's why Major Valerian
would rather I held onto it.

688
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,228
All right.

689
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,439
Just don't leave my side.

690
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,031
Commander, the Council is waiting.

691
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,036
Okay, let's do this.

692
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:38,749
Stay here.

693
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,252
[robot language]

694
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,483
[General Okto-Bar]
<i>En route to the meeting.</i>

695
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:46,507
Received, General.

696
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,893
You stay on backup.
I'll take the front line.

697
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,355
Yes, sir.

698
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:11,032
Delegates, thank you
for answering the call so quickly.

699
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,744
As the elected representative
of the Human Federation,

700
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:17,028
I have called this meeting
of the Alpha Security Council

701
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,292
to update you regarding the state
of emergency we find ourselves in.

702
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,169
As you all know,

703
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,339
the heart of historic Alpha Station
has been contaminated by a force

704
00:49:26,423 --> 00:49:28,633
whose power we do not know the origins of.

705
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,679
The Human Federation has launched
several small military attacks

706
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,973
in order to ascertain
the severity of the threat,

707
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,642
but these have all ended in failure.

708
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,729
And with some significant
losses among our troops.

709
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,607
In light of this alarming
and growing threat to us all,

710
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,108
the Human Federation is seeking...

711
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:46,276
Everything okay?

712
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,738
You're missing out.
I'm having a lot of fun.

713
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,616
Yeah. Don't worry,
we'll be on the beach soon.

714
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,094
I can now answer
any questions you may have

715
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,745
about the details of the operation.

716
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,707
[speaking in alien language]

717
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,669
13th Battalion, Special Assaults Division.

718
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,714
- There she is.
- I told you she was there.

719
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,007
[groans] That's all I need.

720
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,410
[Doghan Dagui 1] Agent Laureline.

721
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,010
- [Valerian] <i>What?</i>
- Doghan Daguis.

722
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,093
[chuckles] Oh.

723
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:15,555
- Nice to see you again.
- Agent Laureline.

724
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:16,473
As resplendent as ever.

725
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,933
Just tell me what you want.

726
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,100
We go where work calls.

727
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:20,519
We speak over 5,000 languages.

728
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,312
Which can be handy in a party like this.

729
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,772
Need our services?

730
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,484
I have my own personal translator.
Now move.

731
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,486
Ask them if they have intel on Mül.

732
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,569
[sighs]

733
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,615
Planet Mül, ring any bells?

734
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,075
A highly sensitive matter.

735
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:36,358
The best person to speak to...

736
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:37,536
Would be Major Samk.

737
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:38,869
Alex?

738
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,206
Major Samk died a year ago.

739
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,291
Well, yes, a most curious demise.

740
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,419
- That was not fully explained.
- Murder some might call it.

741
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:49,548
- [gun charging]
- Major Samk was an expert on Planet Mül.

742
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,317
[Doghan Dagui 2] He took all
that precious information...

743
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,485
[Doghan Dagui 3] To the grave with him.

744
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:53,343
What a waste.

745
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,387
If you receive any intel on this planet,

746
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,989
- we're interested.
- It would be a pleasure

747
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,015
- to work for you, Laureline.
- Before we go...

748
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,779
- We would like to give you...
- Some info.

749
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:01,850
For free.

750
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,270
- For free?
- Mmm-hmm.

751
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
You guys must be sick.

752
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,832
- The Converter is precious.
- And highly sought-after.

753
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,417
- Mercenaries will come...
- To retrieve it...

754
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,378
- Sooner than you think.
- What kind of mercenaries?

755
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:12,571
- The first tip was free.
- You must pay for more.

756
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,239
But you get a discount, of course.

757
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:18,159
[alarm blaring]

758
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,328
General, we have an alert on Section B.

759
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:23,290
- Alex, what's that?
- [Alex] <i>A dozen individuals approaching.</i>

760
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:26,001
- What kind of individuals?
<i>- Undetectable for now.</i>

761
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:28,295
It appears your info just lost its value.

762
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,171
Now get out of my face.

763
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:31,673
[all whining]

764
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,633
- Move, pigeons.
- She just called us pigeons.

765
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,037
- What's a pigeon?
- I don't know.

766
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:39,657
- Where are they coming from?
- [Alex] <i>Everywhere.</i>

767
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,974
<i>They're going through the walls.</i>

768
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,892
Alex, I need to know
the attackers' identity.

769
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:44,811
Everyone, please evacuate.

770
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,022
[Alex] <i>I cannot read their DNA.</i>

771
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,397
What?

772
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:50,316
[door buzzes]

773
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,820
Sir, the door's locked. We can't get out.

774
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:55,572
- Laureline.
- I'm coming.

775
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:56,989
[gate opens]

776
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,119
- Evacuate the Commander.
- Copy that.

777
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,371
General, secure that door.

778
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,113
- Commander.
- What's going on?

779
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,875
- We need to evacuate.
- Let's go.

780
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:12,839
- It's not working.
- What? Alex, open the door.

781
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:19,262
[screaming]

782
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:28,437
[grunts]

[beeps]

[coughs]

786

[gasping]

787
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,074
[Laureline gasps]

788
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,749
- What was that?
- The Pearls.

789
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,294
They took the Commander.
Here, take this. Free the General.

790
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,272
Go to the command room
and track them from there.

791
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,130
Okay.

792
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,549
- [grunts]
- [gasping]

793
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,473
[beeps]

794
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,268
[beeps]

795
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,288
- Are we back to full power?
- Yes, sir, just now.

796
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:33,730
Everybody, back to your posts!

797
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,863
Status on Major Valerian?
Level 5 emergency.

798
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:42,946
Confirmed.

799
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,242
Valerian, I've got you on visual.

800
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,386
[Valerian] <i>Okay,
but I've lost track of them.</i>

801
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,661
<i>Try to locate the Commander.</i>

802
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:58,004
Okay, I've got him.
He's near the docking bay,

803
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,687
so he must be headed towards the vessel.

804
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:04,219
[panting]
Okay, what's the shortest way there?

805
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,971
North-northeast, 113 degrees.

806
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:11,434
- Sixty, 70, 80, 90.
- [beeping]

807
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,941
That leads me straight into a wall.
You said you wanted the shortest way.

808
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:17,941
[sighs]

809
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,067
[beeping]

810
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,316
It may be the shortest way,
but it's not the easiest.

811
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:08,825
[alarms wailing]

812
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,411
Keep going. You're almost there.

813

[speaking in alien language]

814
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,426
They've reached another ship.
No tags, unknown model.

815
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,888
Valerian, they've boarded. Change of plan.
A hundred and forty degrees east.

816
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,055
Alex will pick you up.

817
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,605
- [Valerian] <i>81?</i>
- That's it. 81, straight.

818
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,441
[grunts]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

819
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,818
- 81? You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

820
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:46,321
Because I just went through
and I'm falling in space.

821
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,243
Sorry, my mistake. It was number 18.

822
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:54,787
That's okay. We all make mistakes.

823
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,581
Any idea to get me out of here?

824
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,291
Alex, pick him up on 81.

825
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,513
I'm in. Close it.

826
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,097

[beeping]

831
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:36,412
I'm not sure where you come from,
but I know where I'm gonna send you.

832
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,556
[Laureline] <i>Valerian, hold still.
We're analyzing its system of defense.</i>

833
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:01,729
Major, their protective shield

834
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,374
is too sophisticated.
You won't get through.

835
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,899
I'm gonna try something bigger.

836
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,238
Shit!

[spaceships whooshing]

838
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:17,874
Laureline, which one
has the Commander on board?

[Laureline] <i>Nine o'clock,
lower level. Hurry up.</i>

<i>That's the one. Don't lose it.</i>

841
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,682
Valerian, be careful.

[lasers firing]

843
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:58,536
The Intruder's too big to follow them.
I'm gonna take the SkyJet.

844
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:00,537
Okay.

845
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,057
Okay, Valerian, you're near the Dead Zone.

846
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,225
Reel them in before I lose you.

847

[Laureline] <i>Valerian,
you need to go faster.</i>

00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,465
Valerian, you've got 10 seconds
before I lose you.

851
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,633
Take that.

Valerian, you've got five seconds.

855
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:06,229
Oh, no. Not me.

Valerian, answer me. Valerian, answer me.

- You won't be going after him.
- Why not?

874
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,072
That zone is under enemy
control. It's too dangerous.

875
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,365
An enemy that we don't know!

876
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,033
An enemy that's just attacked us!

877
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:03,303
By putting us to sleep
and not hurting a single one of us!

878
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,621
Why would they spare our lives?
Give me one good reason.

879
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:07,748
I don't know.

880
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,918
Valerian has seen these creatures before.
They are from Planet Mül.

881
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,588
Planet Mül was destroyed 30 years ago.

882
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,250
You're not making any sense.

883
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,133
It's our mission
that doesn't make sense, sir!

884
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,301
Someone is lying to us,

885
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,387
and while you find out who,
I'm going to go save my partner.

886
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:25,933
[converter chirping]

887
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,357
General, Major Valerian
is an invaluable agent.

888
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:35,359
You cannot afford to lose him.

889
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,987
No, I can't afford to lose
both of you in one day.

890
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:40,155
Restrain her.

891
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:46,787
Put us on high alert,

892
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,290
and find me the Commander.

893
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:50,749
Yes, sir.

894
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:05,556
[Doghan Daguis chattering]

895
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:12,355
Listen, I don't wanna tell you guys
how to do your jobs,

896
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,106
but don't you think you should cuff me?

897
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:16,359
Firstly, because it's protocol,
but secondly,

898
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,611
because I'm very tempted to escape.

899
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,573
[clangs and charges up]

900
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,700
[grunting]

901
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:35,543
Good job, boys.

902
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:40,508
[chattering]

903
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,927
- [all gasp]
- We need to talk.

904
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,471
Oh, it's dark in here.

905
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:49,809
- Ow!
- Sorry.

906
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:52,937
If you don't help me find Valerian,
then this bullet's gonna find you.

907
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,106
- You're up first.
- No, no, no, no.

908
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,501
- It's to avoid such situations...
- That all of our information...

909
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,836
- [Doghan Dagui 3] Is divided three ways.
- Kill one of us...

910
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,220
- And you kill the information.
- What a pity that would be.

911
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,299
Okay. You're gonna have to
give me credit, though,

912
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,409
- 'cause I don't have much on me.
- Oh, how tiresome.

913
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,179
- If the Commander were here...
- He could use the Converter to pay us.

914
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,121
But he's been abducted...

915
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,081
Precisely because he had the Converter
on him.

916
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,499
Unless, for security reasons...

917
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,167
Someone else was carrying it on them.

918
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,087
- [converter chirping]
- How in space did you get that info?

919
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:19,824
- It's not info.
- Just deduction.

920
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,175
- We know how humans work.
- They're all so predictable.

921
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:25,511
- Clearly you've never met a woman.
- [all exclaim]

922
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,138
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Calm down.

923
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,431
What do you want to know?

924
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,016
Valerian's exact location.

925
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,267
Hard to tell.

926
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,536
But we know how to track him down...

927
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,560
With complete precision.

928
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:36,147
- How much?
- One hundred baduls.

929
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,982
- Each.
- Forget about it.

930
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,108
This is all I have.

931
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,821
Diamonds are less valuable than baduls.

932
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:44,947
The negotiation is over.

933
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:46,949
- We trust you.
- And under the circumstances...

934
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:48,659
- We accept the deal.
- Good.

935
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,995
Now take me to Valerian. Now.

936
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,204
[together] Follow us.

937
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,789
Philips, head to the location

938
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:55,082
where the Major disappeared.

939
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,585
Milo, track down Agent Laureline
and bring her in.

940
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:00,588
- Neza, inform the Minister.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,049
Just give me a few minutes, please.

942
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,511
Declassify.

943
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,724
I need all information on the Planet Mül.

944
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:16,687
Well, who has authority over this file?

945
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,898
[beeping]

946
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:28,449
[Doghan Dagui 1] Here we are.

947
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,172
[Doghan Dagui 2]
I do not like this place.

948
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,243
[all groan]

949
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:34,537
Here.

950
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:43,381
I've got a bad feeling
about this idea of yours.

951
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:51,429
Bingo.

952
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,478
[burps]
What do you want?

953
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,664
- We'd like to go fishing...
- For a cortex jellyfish.

954
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:00,940
Male, if possible.

955
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:05,945
Nah, it's not the season.

956
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,570
Here.

957
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,326
- Males are harder to catch.
- And here.

958
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:16,288
Welcome aboard.

959
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:23,963
- [bell trilling]
- Uh...

960
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,131
The thing, down.

961
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,217
- The... Down. The thing, down.
- This one?

962
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,386
[groans]

963
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,470
[clangs]

964
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:42,857
There. Bromosaurs.

965
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,109
[chuckling]

966
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:51,078
- [Laureline] Are they dangerous?
- Not really.

967
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,075
You just have to be careful
they don't inhale you.

968
01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:55,452
[mimics inhaling]

969
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:02,710
[creatures humming]

970
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,048
There, that one is a male.

971
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,181
How can you tell?

972
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:17,892
Oh, they're much smaller than the females.

973
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,740
How do you know that that one
has a jellyfish on it?

974
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:33,823
All males do.

975
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,035
The Bromosaurs blow out pure water,

976
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:38,537
<i>which the jellyfish can't do without.</i>

977
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,664
That's why they live
on them all year round,

978
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:43,876
and that's where they get
their hypersensitivity from.

979
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:54,220
Soft as silk.

980
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:55,554
Can I help? I'm a good driver.

981
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,264
[shushing]

[thuds]

985
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:16,325
- Seat belt.
- What?

986
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:19,995
[grunting]

987
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,712
[gasps]

988
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,550
- [man] Seat belt.
- [seatbelt clicks]

989
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:34,194
I thought you said
they weren't aggressive.

990
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,818
Except when you take their little buddy.

991
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,512
Great.

992
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:44,144
[growling]

993
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,169
- [sighs]
- [bell trills]

994
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,546
I'm Bob, by the way.

995
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:12,922
Hi.

996
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,072
[Doghan Dagui 1] There's no time to lose.

997
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,416
[Doghan Dagui 2] The cortex jellyfish
is extremely fragile.

998
01:08:21,724 --> 01:08:23,017
Show it images of Valerian...

999
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,620
And it will show you what it has seen.

1000
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,562
Sure, but how?

1001
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:27,831
- You have to put it...
- On your head...

1002
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:28,897
Down to your shoulders.

1003
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:31,084
- You're kidding?
- Never when we're working.

1004
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,086
- Through a kind of osmosis...
- You'll be able to communicate.

1005
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,171
- But be very careful...
- Not to stay under there...

1006
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,363
Longer than a minute.

1007
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:37,507
Because then it starts to feed...

1008
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,574
On your memory.

1009
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:42,995
Great. Anything else I should know before

1010
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,997
I voluntarily stick my head on his mouth?

1011
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:46,832
Actually, it's not his mouth.

1012
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:48,035
- You can begin.
- Good luck.

1013
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:51,795
[exhales]

1014
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:54,465
- Don't forget.
- One minute.

1015
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,548
Not a second more.

1016
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:01,055
I knew I had it in here somewhere.
There we are. Aha!

1017
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,433
Pe-ew!

1018
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,188
- [stopwatch starts]
- There we go.

1019
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:11,857
This is so exciting.

1020
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,151
[Laureline] Valerian?

1021
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,238
[Valerian yells]

1022
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,508
[Valerian] I only work with my partner.

1023
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,439
[Laureline] Valerian, answer me!

1024
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,338
[Valerian] What can I do
to make it up to you?

1025
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:34,421
[gasping]

1026
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:35,506
Thirty seconds.

1027
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:37,161
[Laureline] Valerian, answer me!

1028
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:38,758
Take that.

1029
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:43,263
[yells]

1030
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,432
Laureline! I'm losing control!

1031
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,101
[Laureline] Valerian!

1032
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,606
- [Laureline] Valerian!
- [Valerian] <i>Laureline!</i>

1033
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,774
Forty seconds.

1034
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,067
[gasping]

1035
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:56,818
[Laureline] Valerian!

1036
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,536
- Fifty seconds! Get out!
- Now!

1037
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,912
Fifty-five seconds!

1038
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,498
[Laureline] Valerian!

1039
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:11,916
Valerian.

1040
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:16,213
[Laureline] Valerian!

1041
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,843
- Beautiful.
- Incredible.

1042
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:23,178
- One minute...
- And 10 seconds.

1043
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,262
A record.

1044
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:29,434
Okay...

1045
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:37,192
"L.630.E-S-U-L deactivated."

1046
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:39,153
Any idea what that means, guys?

1047
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:41,655
- Level 630 East.
- Most likely a sulfate pipe.

1048
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:43,282
Deactivated, apparently.

1049
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,784
Okay. Okay, thanks.

1050
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:48,120
[together]
You need a detailed map?

1051
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,166
We biologically traced
Sergeant Laureline to here.

1052
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,834
What's she doing out by the Galana Sea?

1053
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,087
No idea, sir. She stole a vehicle.

1054
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,923
She headed into the Red Zone,
and we lost track of her.

1055
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,594
She must have located the Major.

1056
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,888
<i>General, there are three civilians here</i>

1057
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:08,091
<i>who claim to have information
that might interest you.</i>

1058
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:09,474
Show them in.

1059
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:12,478
Ah...

1060
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,146
It's you three.

1061
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,901
- Our humble respects, General.
- May you be healthy...

1062
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,652
- And prosperous.
- What do you want?

1063
01:11:20,736 --> 01:11:22,380
We have information
of the utmost importance.

1064
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,448
- That we're ready to sell.
- 100 baduls.

1065
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:27,826
- [together] Each.
- Shoot.

1066
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:40,798
Valerian!

1067
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:41,882
[echoes]

1068
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,266
Move, lizard.

1069
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,947
Valerian? Valerian, do you hear me?

1070
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,282
[beeps]

1071
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:12,412
Valerian, wake up. Valerian, please.

1072
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,374
Stay with me, Valerian. Come on. Come on.

1073
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:17,835
[gasps]

1074
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,169
[coughing]

1075
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:30,097
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

1076
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,723
You totaled your SkyJet, remember?

1077
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:36,687
Yeah. I lost it in a curve.

1078
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,398
You mean you almost died.
You're lucky I found you.

1079
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,334
What about the Commander?
Do we know where he is?

1080
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:42,358
There's no sign of him.

1081
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:44,173
Their spaceship went into a Red Zone.

1082
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:46,696
We gotta find him.

1083
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:49,199
- [grunts] Let's go.
- Wait.

1084
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,830
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

1085
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,957
No "Thank you?" No "Well done?"

1086
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,525
I would have done the same for you.

1087
01:13:05,716 --> 01:13:08,302
- You little prick.
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, chill.

1088
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:10,679
I trusted you more than I trusted myself.

1089
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,122
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No.

1090
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,225
You are an amazing woman, Laureline.

1091
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,203
It's no wonder I wanna marry you.

1092
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,022
Why would I wanna marry
an ungrateful, conceited...

1093
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,505
Because you can't live without him.

1094
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,585
I mean, look, whenever he wanders off,
you go chasing after him.

1095
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,070
[sighs]

1096
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,239
I was just doing my job, Major.

1097
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:32,034
Now will you please let me
get back to the mission?

1098
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,244
Yeah, sure.

1099
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:35,662
Good.

1100
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:36,746
Sergeant.

1101
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:44,689
Captain, what's going on here?

1102
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:47,341
I report directly
to the Commander Arun Filitt.

1103
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:49,184
- I don't have to...
- I am General Okto-Bar!

1104
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,887
In the absence of the Commander,
I am in command on Alpha!

1105
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:53,638
Arrest this man!

1106
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:55,765
And release that one.

1107
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,644
[chattering]

1108
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,481
I apologize for your mistreatment.

1109
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:06,109
We will take you to a jail
but our doctors will take care of you.

1110
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:11,072
Help us.

1111
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:13,866
If you need my help,

1112
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,426
you have to tell me everything you know.

1113
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,052
But first of all,
why are you attacking us?

1114
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:25,128
Because you have...
what we need.

1115
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:40,662
Didn't you say that the girl in your dream

1116
01:14:40,686 --> 01:14:43,397
- had a Converter just like mine?
- That's right.

1117
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,416
So if the animals are native
on their planet then,

1118
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,610
surely it's understandable that they want
to retrieve the last living specimen.

1119
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:50,570
Yeah, and they probably
kidnapped the Commander

1120
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,048
because they thought he was carrying it.

1121
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:53,424
Yeah, once they find out he's not,

1122
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,848
then I'll be the top of their list.

1123
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,960
Don't worry, I'm not letting
you go anywhere.

1124
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:59,079
No, I'm not letting you go anywhere.

1125
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:01,790
[chuckles]

1126
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,042
Wow.

1127
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,254
[growling]

1128
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,305
Pretty butterfly.

1129
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,225
Sure, but whatever you do,
don't touch them.

1130
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:22,769
- Why?
- Because some of them are...

1131
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,022
- No!
- [gasps]

1132
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,189
Valerian!

1133
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:29,567
Laureline!

1134
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,739
I'm coming! I'm coming. I'm coming.

1135
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,666
[grunts]

1136
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,003
[grunts]

1137
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,591
[grunting]

1138
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:53,842
[chattering]

1139
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,599
Let me go, fatty. Come on, put me down.

1140
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:05,062
Sorry, I'm inedible.

1141
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,022
[panting]

1142
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:08,522
Valerian!

1143
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,651
[grunts]

1144
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,990
- [beeps]
- [Alex] <i>Major, I can read your signal now.</i>

1145
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,950
- [Laureline] Valerian!
- [growls]

1146
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:33,131
Alex, any ideas?

1147
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,634
[Alex] <i>The only way
to get in without creating</i>

1148
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,804
<i>a severe diplomatic incident
is to pass for one of them.</i>

1149
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,515
<i>I suggest you try to find a glamopod.</i>

1150
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:45,143
Thanks, Alex.

1151
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:56,780
Have you run a DNA search?

1152
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:01,284
Yes, but it didn't match
any of the 800 million species

1153
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:03,471
- we have in that database.
- Well, how's that possible?

1154
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:05,872
Either it belongs to a
completely unknown species...

1155
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:07,165
Or?

1156
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:09,709
Or this species was deliberately deleted
from the database.

1157
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,507
General, the Major has resurfaced

1158
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,710
at the edge of the Red Zone.

1159
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:18,135
Which district is he in?

1160
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:19,635
Paradise Alley.

1161
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:23,139
Notify all units.

1162
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:29,271
[sergeant] <i>All units.
Search alert. Major Valerian.</i>

1163
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:32,357
<i>Not dangerous. Find and assist.</i>

1164
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:37,154
- Can I help you?
- Sure you can. Move.

1165
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,160
Good. Now slide your gun into my holster.

1166
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:46,693
- [holster clicks]
- Hold still.

1167
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:55,422
[music playing]

1168
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:09,728
Hi, sugar.

1169
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:12,439
Do you wanna ride?

1170
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,361
Hey.
[purrs]

1171
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,198
Hey, you wanna fly?

1172
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,450
I'm allergic to feathers.

1173
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:25,952
My hero.

1174
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,662
You got the wrong guy.

1175
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,622
[giggling]

1176
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:35,545
[speaking in French]

1177
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:36,796
Huh. I...

1178
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,880
I don't speak French.

1179
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,136
Hello.

1180
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,139
[man announcing over speakers]

1181
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:48,642
Come on, out. Pervert.

1182
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,020
Hey, cowboy.
You've come to the right spot.

1183
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,189
It's the best damn club
on the whole space station.

1184
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,352
- [woman] Hey, Jolly.
- I'll be with you in a second.

1185
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,361
I'm looking for something special.

1186
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:01,947
Well, of course you are.
Whatever it is you want,

1187
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,407
- [clicks tongue] I got it.
- [chuckles]

1188
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,159
- I'm not so sure about...
- Well, I am.

1189
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:08,095
Tell me, what is it you want?
What are you looking for?

1190
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,372
- A glamopod.
- You are so lucky.

1191
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:12,999
I got the best one
in the whole universe. Come on!

1192
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:14,501
[women giggling]

1193
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,585
[woman] Jolly.

1194
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:18,254
Come on.

1195
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,844
[humming]

1196
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:32,060
Hey, I work for the government.

1197
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,145
[all grunting]

1198
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:39,567
If you want to avoid a diplomatic incident
you better let me go right now.

1199
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,152
[laughing]

1200
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,992
Look, listen. I didn't come
here to get a makeover.

1201
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:49,494
I need to leave. Do you understand?

1202
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,371
[laughs]

1203
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:53,456
[sighs]

1204
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,125
[laughs]

1205
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,334
I can't believe it.

1206
01:19:57,002 --> 01:19:59,337
I'm not here to try on a stupid dress!

1207
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:00,755
Call your chief or a translator

1208
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,173
so we can at least communicate.

1209
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,053
Do you understand what I am saying?

1210
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:12,434
- [screams]
- [gasps]

1211
01:20:12,934 --> 01:20:15,103
[roars]

1212
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:17,730
Hmm.

1213
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,607
Okay.

1214
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,783
This is where you lose
the hardware, soldier boy.

1215
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,618
I'd rather hold onto it. I'm on duty.

1216
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:32,871
Yeah, well, unfortunately rules are rules,

1217
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,498
and this is a place where
we make love, not war.

1218
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:39,919
Here's your ticket.

1219
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,340
Don't lose it. [chuckles]

1220
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:44,423
Can we make a deal?

1221
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,844
Let's not talk about business, can we?

1222
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:49,553
Let's talk pleasure.

1223
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:51,639
What kinda music are you into, huh?

1224
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:54,517
You like techno? Macro? Bio? Nano?

1225
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,311
- I'm more retro.
- Oh. Me, too.

1226
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:57,395
Oldies are goodies.

1227
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:03,568
Sit down. Relax. And enjoy the show.

1228
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:07,322
[exhaling]

1229
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,826
[playing organ]

1230
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:27,634
[upbeat music playing]

1231
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:48,238
[gasps]

1232
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,159
[laughs]

1233
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,668
[laughing]

1234
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,342
Ha! [laughs]

1235
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,596
- [drums on organ]
- [sighs]

1236
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,432
[Jolly] I don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

1237
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:49,901
So what'll it be, soldier?

1238
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:52,737
Look, that was really cool,

1239
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,590
but not exactly what
I'm looking for right now.

1240
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:57,676
Well I have a whole lot more in stock
if you just tell me what you have in mind.

1241
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,701
I have a lot in mind.

1242
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,037
And no time for this. I'll pass.

1243
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,541
Listen, I have a problem
and I really need your help.

1244
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:05,976
You didn't like my performance?

1245
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,126
No, no, yeah. I...

1246
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:12,257
- I loved it. Absolutely.
- I started at age four.

1247
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,009
Learning my trade in all the top schools.

1248
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,680
- I can play anyone or anything.
- I'm sure you can.

1249
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,603
I know all of Shakespeare
by heart if you want.

1250
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,183
Poetry maybe? You like poetry?

1251
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,061
- Sure.
- Rimbaud? Verlaine?

1252
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,396
Tough choice.

1253
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:33,111
"I'm afraid of a kiss...

1254
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:38,116
Like the kiss of a bee...

1255
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:41,077
I suffer like this...

1256
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:44,038
And wake endlessly...

1257
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,875
I'm afraid of a kiss."

1258
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:54,298
[gun charging]

1259
01:24:54,716 --> 01:24:56,718
How about I tell you
what I really have in mind?

1260
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:58,928
[screaming]

1261
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:01,347
- No, quit screaming.
- How'd you get a gun?

1262
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,226
- Hey... [screams]
- [electricity crackling]

1263
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,521
Major Valerian, I advise you
to put that gun down.

1264
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:14,027
- And I advise you to sit down.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1265
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,821
- Please! No! Don't shoot me!
- What the hell is that?

1266
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,656
That is you, when you were 10.

1267
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,700
You're not going to
shoot yourself, are you?

1268
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,785
- Will you go back to normal, please?
- Okay, okay.

1269
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,248
No. Not this normal. The other one.

1270
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:28,332
Okay, okay.

1271
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:33,588
Thank you. What's your name?

1272
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:34,982
Whatever you want it to be, sweetie.

1273
01:25:35,006 --> 01:25:38,086
I don't have time for your games, sweetie.
Come on, tell me, what's your name?

1274
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,179
[sighs]

1275
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,138
Bubble.

1276
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:46,059
Look, Bubble, I lost my partner.

1277
01:25:46,142 --> 01:25:47,977
If you help me find her,
I'll set you free.

1278
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,773
What good is freedom when
you're an illegal immigrant

1279
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:54,359
- far away from home?
- I work for the government.

1280
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,277
I'll get you an ID pass. You have my word.

1281
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,990
[sighs] If I leave, Jolly will kill me.

1282
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,867
No, Jolly won't kill anybody ever again.

1283
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:11,042
So what do you say, Bubble?

1284
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,337
You really liked my performance?

1285
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,506
Best I ever saw.

1286
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,636
Thank you.

1287
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:24,138
You're welcome.

1288
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:30,728
[clears throat]

1289
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,605
So, I'm gonna take 10.

1290
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,274
You two keep an eye on old soldier boy.

1291
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,777
He seems like a real freak to me.

1292
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,030
[clears throat]

1293
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,991
Okay, Bubble, get off me.

1294
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,083
[Bubble] All right, all right,
I'm doing this.

1295
01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:48,955
[grunts]

1296
01:26:51,082 --> 01:26:51,916
[sighs]

1297
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:52,999
Hey, you good?

1298
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,751
Thanks.

1299
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:02,218
- You wanna go in there?
- Yeah, but no foreigners are allowed.

1300
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:04,021
The only way in
is to look like one of them.

1301
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,973
Oh, no, no, no! I've never played
a Boulan Bathor before.

1302
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,725
What? Are you an artist or not?

1303
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:14,105
Yes, but I need time to get into my role,
and capture my movements and behaviors,

1304
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:15,606
and character's arc.

1305
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,817
We do a couple rehearsals,
you give me some notes...

1306
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,361
Well, a little improv never hurt anyone.
Let's go.

1307
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:22,779
[sighs]

1308
01:27:23,281 --> 01:27:24,281
All right.

1309
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:26,575
Turn around.

1310
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:30,579
[grunts]

1311
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:34,833
Ugh.

1312
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,335
This is not right.

1313
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:38,546
I need a manicure.

1314
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,967
[humming]

1315
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:49,265
Don't you think the hat
might be a little bit over the top?

1316
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,392
Uh... Uh...

1317
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,185
Never mind.

1318
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:58,316
[Valerian] Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

1319
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:00,279
[Bubble] Give me a second
to get the hang of it.

1320
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:02,296
[Valerian] Hurry, people
are staring at us.

1321
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,155
[Bubble] I told you I needed rehearsals.

1322
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:05,698
This is a heavy role.

1323
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:07,824
[Valerian] Much better.

1324
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,159
You're doing good.

1325
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:17,335
General, we've picked up
the Major's trail again.

1326
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,629
Finally. Where is he?

1327
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:21,839
In Boulan Bathor territory.

1328
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:22,965
In the...

1329
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,052
Nobody gets in there.

1330
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:27,553
And definitely not out of there.

1331
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:29,721
[sighs]

1332
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,117
We'll need reinforcements.
Inform the Minister.

1333
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:33,141
Yes, sir.

1334
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:42,567
[grunts]

1335
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,963
[Bubble] So how did you come
to lose your partner?

1336
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,715
- [Valerian] Because I'm stupid.
- [Bubble] What do you mean?

1337
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,259
[Valerian] All I do is flirt and joke.

1338
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,302
[Bubble] Oh, trying to be cool
rather than being honest?

1339
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:51,160
[Valerian] Story of my life.

1340
01:28:51,244 --> 01:28:53,222
[Bubble] How young were you
when you lost your mom?

1341
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:54,640
[Valerian] Please don't
go there right now.

1342
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:56,624
[Bubble] It's okay to be
vulnerable sometimes.

1343
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,310
[Valerian] Can we stop this and get back
to the mission, please?

1344
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:59,334
And don't touch anything.

1345
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,855
[Bubble] Well, it wouldn't
hurt you to show some weakness.

1346
01:29:01,879 --> 01:29:02,940
[Valerian] I'm not good at that.

1347
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:04,525
[Bubble] It will make her feel important.

1348
01:29:04,549 --> 01:29:07,669
[Valerian] Yeah, believe me, she's already
the most important thing in my life.

1349
01:29:08,177 --> 01:29:09,177
[grunts]

1350
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,578
[Valerian] I think he wants us
to join the group.

1351
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,312
[Bubble] I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1352
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,341
[Valerian] It doesn't look like
he's giving us much choice.

1353
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,576
[grunting]

1354
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:35,872
[Bubble] What's going on?

1355
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,708
[Valerian] I guess it's lunchtime
for Emperor Boulan Ill.

1356
01:29:42,295 --> 01:29:43,796
[grunting]

1357
01:29:50,428 --> 01:29:52,889
[Bubble] Bussing tables,
every artist's worst nightmare.

1358
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:54,640
Never mention this to anyone, okay?

1359
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:57,084
[Valerian] Thank your lucky stars
we're not the main course.

1360
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:00,730
[grunting]

1361
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:03,773
Oh...

1362
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,321
- [grunting]
- [exclaiming]

1363
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:16,787
[Bubble] I'm going to be sick.

1364
01:30:18,581 --> 01:30:19,581
[grunting]

1365
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:22,752
[groans]

1366
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:24,003
[gags]

1367
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:39,602
[Valerian] There she is.

1368
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,646
[Bubble] Wow. You're right, she's a 10.

1369
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:49,070
Hmm? [grunting]

1370
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:07,880
[grunting]

1371
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,717
- Hi.
- [grunting]

1372
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:20,017
[sighs]

1373
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:23,229
- [Lemon squirting]
- [chuckles]

1374
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,582
- [Valerian] Something's wrong.
- [Bubble] How about I do a little dance,

1375
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,167
- to create a diversion?
- [Valerian] No, thanks.

1376
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:28,484
[grunts]

1377
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:29,567
[clangs]

1378
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:34,949
[screams]

1379
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,784
[Laureline grunting]

1380
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:40,746
- You guys are in big trouble!
- [Bubble] I think we should go.

1381
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,750
[Valerian] I think you should
let me handle this.

1382
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:47,420
- Valerian!
- [Valerian] I'm in here!

1383
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:11,776
[Valerian] Hey.

1384
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:13,946
[screams]

1385
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,698
You're gonna be a good boy, okay?

1386
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,575
Down! Stay!

1387
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:19,744
[Valerian] Laureline, it's me. Valerian.

1388
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:20,661
What?

1389
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:22,079
[groans]

1390
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,417
Oh!

1391
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:29,813
[Valerian] Bubble, get off me.

1392
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:30,897
[Bubble] Yes, you're right, let's go.

1393
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:31,921
Whoo!

1394
01:32:33,174 --> 01:32:34,341
Excuse me, Your Highness.

1395
01:32:36,302 --> 01:32:38,220
[grunting]

1396
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:42,767
[chuckles]

1397
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,393
Hey, baby.

1398
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,440
[both grunt]

1399
01:32:51,901 --> 01:32:52,901
I deserved that.

1400
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:58,490
Watch out!

1401
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,285
This is a lady. You can't fight her.

1402
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,672
[Bubble] Let's talk about this.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

1403
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:16,966
I warned you.

1404
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,401
[panting]

1405
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:38,572
Well, that's what I call a partner.

1406
01:33:39,657 --> 01:33:40,657
Whoo-hoo!

1407
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:45,913
Bravo. That was amazing.
I'm very impressed.

1408
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,540
Hey.

1409
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,750
Hey.

1410
01:33:57,716 --> 01:33:59,260
[all grunting]

1411
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:05,723
Trust me on this.

1412
01:34:06,267 --> 01:34:07,309
[both screaming]

1413
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:08,435
[screaming]

1414
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:20,738
[grunting]

1415
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,631
[Sergeant Neza] Third Regiment
approaching, sir.

1416
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:37,464
- Any news from our agents?
- None.

1417
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:40,634
And the Commander?
Any ransom demands?

1418
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:42,887
Negative. Minister on line.

1419
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:43,970
Okay.

1420
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:46,599
[beeping]

1421
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:48,517
My respects, Minister.

1422
01:34:48,601 --> 01:34:50,811
<i>General, you've been
authorized by the council</i>

1423
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:52,646
<i>to assume command of this operation.</i>

1424
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,231
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

1425
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,277
But to fulfill my mission, I will need
full access to Commander Filitt's data.

1426
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,407
<i>According to regulations, that is
impossible without his explicit agreement.</i>

1427
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:04,909
The Commander may well be dead.

1428
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:10,581
If I am to succeed in my new assignment,
I need to know everything.

1429
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:12,790
[sighs]

1430
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:16,337
<i>- Access granted.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

1431
01:35:22,468 --> 01:35:23,468
Declassify.

1432
01:35:26,013 --> 01:35:27,640
Request file on the Planet Mül.

1433
01:35:28,182 --> 01:35:29,934
[computer] <i>Request authorized.</i>

1434
01:35:31,518 --> 01:35:34,063
Huh. "The Conflict
with the Southern Territories."

1435
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:39,693
"The war against the Azien Korn
led to the destruction of Planet Mül."

1436
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:41,654
Tell me more about the planet.

1437
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:43,989
"The planet was uninhabited."

1438
01:35:46,283 --> 01:35:47,826
Who's in charge of this operation?

1439
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,037
[beeping]

1440
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:53,624
This does not smell good.

1441
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:09,640
[converter chirping]

1442
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:14,311
Told you there was a door.

1443
01:36:14,395 --> 01:36:17,898
Someone didn't look over the plans
before they came rushing in. As usual.

1444
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:20,609
What, you'd rather I'd showed up
after the main event?

1445
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:24,113
I'd rather you took me someplace
other than a giant trash can.

1446
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:26,072
Bubble?

1447
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:31,829
Bubble, where are you? Where is she?

1448
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:33,265
[Laureline] She was right behind us.

1449
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:34,289
[Bubble] I'm here.

1450
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:42,588
What's wrong?

1451
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:44,442
I must've been injured during the fight.

1452
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:47,428
Bubble, tell me what to do.

1453
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:49,596
[gasping]

1454
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,806
Nothing you can do.

1455
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:56,270
Anyway, where I'm from,
life is more painful than death.

1456
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:57,353
Don't say that.

1457
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:00,316
Unfortunately, it's true.

1458
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:05,612
Life's a drag when you don't have
an identity to call your own.

1459
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:07,990
You do have an identity.

1460
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:11,660
You're the greatest artist I've ever seen.

1461
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:17,750
I thank you.

1462
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,675
It was my pleasure performing for you.

1463
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,762
I leave you my kingdom.

1464
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:32,847
Take good care of it.

1465
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,390
I will.

1466
01:37:34,808 --> 01:37:36,101
But most importantly...

1467
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:38,019
Yeah?

1468
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:39,730
Take good care of her.

1469
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,778
Love her without measure.

1470
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:50,491
"There's beggary in love
that can be reckoned."

1471
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:15,890
Let's go.

1472
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,032
[beeps]

1473
01:38:33,742 --> 01:38:35,411
All the battleships have docked, General.

1474
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:38,122
Good. I want Section 1
operative as soon as possible.

1475
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:39,706
What are those K-tron doing there?

1476
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,931
The Commander programmed them personally.

1477
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,587
- They can't be deactivated.
- Great.

1478
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,673
That's all we need.

1479
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:56,324
Do you have any idea where we're going?

1480
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,016
Yeah, sure. I mean...

1481
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:03,397
- I guess.
- You're sure or you guess?

1482
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,080
Look, I know it sounds strange but it...

1483
01:39:07,443 --> 01:39:09,820
The Princess, she's guiding me.

1484
01:39:10,404 --> 01:39:13,115
The Princess? She's guiding you?

1485
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,076
Yeah. Look, it's hard to explain,

1486
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:20,956
but it's like she's been
with me the whole time.

1487
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:22,623
Wait.

1488
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:26,462
You mean to tell me
that you've had a woman

1489
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:30,090
inside of you since the beginning?

1490
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,010
Laureline, can we just keep going, please?

1491
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:34,093
Sure.

1492
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:38,307
- Ladies first.
- Ha! Hilarious.

1493
01:39:43,687 --> 01:39:45,022
[soldier shouting indistinctly]

1494
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:46,665
[soldier 1] Go, fill it in! Fill it in!

1495
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:49,252
- [alarm blaring]
- [soldier 2] Over there!

1496
01:39:49,276 --> 01:39:51,487
Captain Kris. Section 1 operational.
General?

1497
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:54,406
Proceed. A unit of K-trons will join you.

1498
01:39:55,616 --> 01:39:58,535
- That won't be necessary.
- Commander's orders, not mine.

1499
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:01,246
Copy that. Move on!

1500
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:05,250
[animals squeaking and chittering]

1501
01:40:19,014 --> 01:40:20,766
We've been manipulated from the start.

1502
01:40:21,517 --> 01:40:22,392
What do you mean?

1503
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:25,036
We're in the middle of the Dead Zone
and we can breathe properly.

1504
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:27,397
It seems there's no sign of contamination.

1505
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:34,655
The Commander's fully aware of what's
behind this so-called absolute evil.

1506
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:37,657
What?

1507
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:45,082
Pearls.

1508
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:48,335
My name is Tsûuri. I am the Emperor's son.

1509
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:50,396
Great. How about
you introduce us to Daddy?

1510
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,755
He is expecting you.

1511
01:40:54,925 --> 01:40:56,925
Try to contact the General.
Get everyone down here.

1512
01:40:57,094 --> 01:40:58,094
I'll buy us some time.

1513
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:01,306
How about you run for backup for a change?

1514
01:41:07,104 --> 01:41:08,104
Unbelievable.

1515
01:41:35,299 --> 01:41:36,299
Follow me.

1516
01:42:17,299 --> 01:42:20,260
I'd like you to meet
my father, the Emperor.

1517
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:35,734
My name is Haban-Limaï
and this is my wife, Aloi.

1518
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:37,861
[greeting in alien language]

1519
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:39,613
[Aloi] We're pleased to welcome you here.

1520
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,283
My son sensed the presence of his sister,

1521
01:42:43,367 --> 01:42:45,786
Princess Lïhio-Minaa, in you.

1522
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:51,625
It seems she chose you.

1523
01:42:53,585 --> 01:42:54,585
What do you mean?

1524
01:42:58,006 --> 01:42:59,341
At the moment of passing,

1525
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:02,386
Pearls release all the energy
left in their body

1526
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:04,304
in the form of a wave,

1527
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:07,057
which travels through space and time.

1528
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,267
Sometimes it finds a benevolent host.

1529
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,603
Lïho-Minaa chose you

1530
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:14,439
to be the guardian of her soul.

1531
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:18,734
Told you.

1532
01:43:20,904 --> 01:43:22,447
[inhales sharply]

1533
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:28,912
My daughter.

1534
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,253
I'm so happy to see you.

1535
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:38,003
Same here.

1536
01:43:39,756 --> 01:43:42,509
I mean, she is, too.

1537
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:50,100
What exactly happened
to you and your people?

1538
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:56,189
Our planet was a true paradise, on which
we lived in harmony with the elements.

1539
01:43:57,232 --> 01:44:01,987
<i>Our main activity was fishing for the
pearls who possessed phenomenal energy.</i>

1540
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:06,199
<i>They fertilized our lands,
controlled the winds and tides.</i>

1541
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:10,954
<i>Three times a year we gave to the earth,
what the sea had given us.</i>

1542
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:15,876
<i>We lived like this, in harmony,</i>
for centuries and centuries.

1543
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,546
Until the day of the apocalypse.

1544
01:44:20,756 --> 01:44:23,175
[distant rumbling]

1545
01:44:23,258 --> 01:44:25,677
<i>In the sky over our planet,</i>

1546
01:44:26,011 --> 01:44:29,556
<i>other people blindly
fought out a brutal war.</i>

1547
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:32,601
<i>A war between people we didn't even know.</i>

1548
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:21,398
Missiles loaded, sir.

1549
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,527
[commander] Engage fusio-missiles.

1550
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:26,362
Do you confirm, sir?

1551
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,865
[commander] Yes, I do.

1552
01:45:30,826 --> 01:45:31,826
At your command.

1553
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:38,792
By the grace of God.

1554
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:39,875
[console beeping]

1555
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:06,027
Your daughter died during the battle.

1556
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,822
Yes, like six million others.

1557
01:46:13,827 --> 01:46:15,412
What happened after the explosion?

1558
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:18,248
We drifted in space for many years.

1559
01:46:18,582 --> 01:46:21,418
<i>Aboard a vessel we salvaged
from the wreckage,</i>

1560
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,920
<i>and that was half-destroyed.</i>

1561
01:46:27,132 --> 01:46:29,718
[speaking alien language]

1562
01:46:30,385 --> 01:46:33,597
<i>This new environment was
quite different from ours.</i>

1563
01:46:33,847 --> 01:46:37,142
<i>And at first, we needed time
to understand it,</i>

1564
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:41,563
<i>absorbing the vast knowledge
stored in its database.</i>

1565
01:46:50,196 --> 01:46:52,782
<i>We learned languages and mathematics,</i>

1566
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:55,577
<i>physics, chemistry,</i>

1567
01:46:56,036 --> 01:46:58,997
<i>- and philosophy.</i>
- [machine powering up]

1568
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:02,751
<i>We learned about the millions of planets
and stars and moons</i>

1569
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,045
<i>in a universe we never knew existed.</i>

1570
01:47:08,256 --> 01:47:12,135
<i>And we learned of the countless species
who inhabit this universe.</i>

1571
01:47:13,178 --> 01:47:17,515
<i>Including humans, the ones
who destroyed our planet.</i>

1572
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:22,729
<i>Time has not dimmed
the memories of our loss,</i>

1573
01:47:24,064 --> 01:47:28,193
<i>but it has allowed us to let go
of our anger toward those responsible.</i>

1574
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:33,782
[speaking alien language]

1575
01:47:35,283 --> 01:47:40,664
<i>Then, one day, we were picked up
by scrap dealers traveling the galaxy.</i>

1576
01:47:41,331 --> 01:47:44,000
After a few years, their hold was full.

1577
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:51,341
<i>And they went off to sell their cargo
on a huge construction site.</i>

1578
01:47:53,927 --> 01:47:55,929
- Alpha.
- Yes.

1579
01:47:56,012 --> 01:48:00,809
<i>The City of a Thousand Planets,
where for hundreds of years,</i>

1580
01:48:01,226 --> 01:48:03,770
<i>so many species
have shared their knowledge</i>

1581
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,897
<i>and intelligence with each other.</i>

1582
01:48:07,774 --> 01:48:10,568
<i>In the shadows of Alpha,
we lived undetected,</i>

1583
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,905
<i>all the while watching and learning
from each of them.</i>

1584
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:19,953
<i>Until we acquired both the knowledge,</i>

1585
01:48:20,203 --> 01:48:23,289
<i>and the materials
to build a vessel of our own.</i>

1586
01:48:36,094 --> 01:48:39,889
Our planet is gone forever,
but with what we have learned,

1587
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:44,102
we are now able to replicate
and restore our lost world.

1588
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,730
- [machine pulsing gently]
- Amazing.

1589
01:48:46,813 --> 01:48:48,773
There are only two things that we lack.

1590
01:48:49,065 --> 01:48:50,358
A Mül Converter.

1591
01:48:51,735 --> 01:48:52,735
And a pearl.

1592
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:56,114
The only one Tsûuri managed to salvage.

1593
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:15,800
We are survivors,
but that makes us witnesses.

1594
01:49:16,384 --> 01:49:20,680
Witnesses of a past that humans want to
erase and forget forever.

1595
01:49:22,515 --> 01:49:26,144
We can forgive, but how can we forget?

1596
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,981
So we left you no choice
but to steal the Converter,

1597
01:49:30,607 --> 01:49:32,108
and Tsûuri hired a professional.

1598
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:33,193
Igon Siruss.

1599
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,490
But Major Valerian intervenes
and retrieves the Converter.

1600
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:40,033
Which left you with only one choice.

1601
01:49:40,116 --> 01:49:42,577
Kidnap the Commander
and force him to tell you the truth.

1602
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,037
You know our story now.

1603
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:47,373
Our destiny is in your hands.

1604
01:49:58,676 --> 01:49:59,719
[all gasp]

1605
01:50:04,224 --> 01:50:07,519
Major, arrest these creatures immediately.

1606
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:10,331
They kidnapped me.
They're extremely dangerous.

1607
01:50:10,355 --> 01:50:12,398
They're Pearls from the Planet Mül.

1608
01:50:12,982 --> 01:50:14,317
I heard their ridiculous story.

1609
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:15,400
That's impossible.

1610
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:17,153
Mül was uninhabited.

1611
01:50:17,529 --> 01:50:19,906
Their existence proves
the contrary, doesn't it?

1612
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:22,450
I am telling you
there was no life on the planet.

1613
01:50:22,534 --> 01:50:25,120
The detectors were categorical.
Arrest them.

1614
01:50:25,203 --> 01:50:26,496
How can you be so sure?

1615
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:29,082
Because I read the reports and...

1616
01:50:29,165 --> 01:50:30,165
And you were on board.

1617
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:35,505
Yes. Yes, I was on board.

1618
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,467
And we had much more
serious things to worry about.

1619
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:44,514
Our cruisers were being decimated.
We lost 500,000 soldiers in a day.

1620
01:50:46,015 --> 01:50:47,225
It was complete carnage!

1621
01:50:47,934 --> 01:50:49,644
You were so preoccupied you didn't see

1622
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:52,063
the detectors indicating
signs of life on the planet.

1623
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:56,818
Or even worse. Perhaps you knew the planet
was inhabited and you sacrificed it.

1624
01:50:57,402 --> 01:50:59,404
Commander, the planet is inhabited.

1625
01:51:00,155 --> 01:51:02,448
- By primitive life forms.
- No, Commander.

1626
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:05,994
I have detected a complex language
and huge cerebral energy.

1627
01:51:06,077 --> 01:51:07,077
Major.

1628
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,540
History is on the march and neither you

1629
01:51:10,623 --> 01:51:13,543
nor a bunch of savages
are gonna stand in its way.

1630
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:19,340
So when you realized survivors from Planet
Mül were living in the heart of Alpha,

1631
01:51:19,883 --> 01:51:21,968
you decided to erase
any trace of your mistake,

1632
01:51:23,636 --> 01:51:25,305
rather than accept the consequences.

1633
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:28,641
I want no survivors.

1634
01:51:28,725 --> 01:51:32,228
And you destroyed all the evidence
that Major Samk had against you.

1635
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:46,409
What did you expect me to do?
It was the only way!

1636
01:51:52,624 --> 01:51:54,417
Admitting to an error on this scale

1637
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,437
would have exposed our
government to colossal damages

1638
01:51:56,461 --> 01:51:59,088
and compensation claims.
Our economy would never recover.

1639
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:03,426
In one instance, we would have lost
our supremacy and our leadership.

1640
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:05,220
There would have been immediate sanctions,

1641
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:08,556
and it's a pretty good bet that
we would have been banished from Alpha

1642
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,410
and denied access to the greatest
market of knowledge and intelligence.

1643
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:14,187
Is that what you would have wanted
for your fellow citizens?

1644
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:21,778
Leading them into ruin and degradation?
Forcing them to go backwards 1,000 years?

1645
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:26,991
Our Council saw fit to protect
our citizens first and foremost.

1646
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:29,494
Is that not its duty? And mine?

1647
01:52:30,203 --> 01:52:31,843
- [shouting] And yours?
- [Pearls gasping]

1648
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:43,049
Or would you rather risk wrecking
our economy for the sake of a bunch of...

1649
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,132
Savages?

1650
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:47,178
You are totally under the
influence of these creatures.

1651
01:52:47,262 --> 01:52:48,972
Do not confuse the issue.

1652
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:50,306
He's the threat!

1653
01:52:51,099 --> 01:52:52,100
He's the enemy!

1654
01:52:59,315 --> 01:53:02,986
You are your own worst enemy, Commander.

1655
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:08,074
Unless you make peace with your past,
you won't have a future.

1656
01:53:15,248 --> 01:53:19,585
Major, I order you to arrest this man.

1657
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:22,797
Can we talk man-to-man for a second?

1658
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:28,303
Major, what are you doing?

1659
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,008
I taught him how to do that.

1660
01:53:32,765 --> 01:53:33,765
Whew!

1661
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:35,350
Nice talk.

1662
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:42,942
Move on, move on, move on!

1663
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:51,826
Section 1 is entering the Red Zone.

1664
01:53:51,909 --> 01:53:53,786
Prepare Section 2 for an advance also.

1665
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:55,872
Look, this was a lot of fun,

1666
01:53:55,955 --> 01:53:57,515
but we gotta report back to our people.

1667
01:53:58,082 --> 01:54:00,335
Here. That's yours.

1668
01:54:02,295 --> 01:54:03,629
We'll make this right, I promise.

1669
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:06,425
Let's get this guy out.
Whoa, what are you doing?

1670
01:54:06,716 --> 01:54:08,027
I'm giving them back the Converter.

1671
01:54:08,051 --> 01:54:09,260
No.

1672
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:10,762
The pearl is useless without this.

1673
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:11,845
Yeah, but...

1674
01:54:13,973 --> 01:54:15,117
Will you give us a second, please?

1675
01:54:15,141 --> 01:54:16,184
What?

1676
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:20,355
That Converter is government property.

1677
01:54:20,438 --> 01:54:22,318
Most likely, the last one
in the whole universe.

1678
01:54:22,357 --> 01:54:24,567
Oh. So you buy into the Commander's

1679
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:27,445
"What's mine is mine
and what's yours is mine" philosophy?

1680
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:30,990
No, I buy into my oath of allegiance.
We have no authority to hand it over.

1681
01:54:31,074 --> 01:54:33,242
The Federation messed up
and must make amends.

1682
01:54:33,326 --> 01:54:35,286
Yeah, I agree, but that's not
for us to decide.

1683
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,873
- Leave it to the courts.
- They're 18 light years away, Valerian.

1684
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:40,083
Only we can make this right.

1685
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:43,211
Laureline, I'm a soldier.

1686
01:54:43,836 --> 01:54:45,004
I play by the rules.

1687
01:54:46,172 --> 01:54:47,507
It's what makes me who I am.

1688
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,180
You see?

1689
01:54:57,225 --> 01:54:58,768
That's why I don't want to marry you,

1690
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:00,686
because you really don't know
what love is.

1691
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,605
Come on, this has nothing to do with love.

1692
01:55:02,688 --> 01:55:04,273
That's where you're wrong.

1693
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:08,444
Love is more powerful
than anything else, Valerian.

1694
01:55:09,654 --> 01:55:14,158
It breaks all rules and laws,
and overpowers any army or government.

1695
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:15,951
Just look at her.

1696
01:55:17,537 --> 01:55:19,705
For one second,
put yourself in her position.

1697
01:55:20,206 --> 01:55:24,544
She lost all of her people and her child,
and she's willing to forgive.

1698
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:26,921
That's real love.

1699
01:55:27,547 --> 01:55:29,382
It's the trust you place in someone else,

1700
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:33,175
and I thought I could be
that someone else for you.

1701
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:36,848
- But clearly...
- You can.

1702
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:40,058
You are.

1703
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,229
I'd die for you.

1704
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:46,149
I'm not asking you to die for me.

1705
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:50,111
I'm asking you to trust me.

1706
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,842
All right, give it to 'em.

1707
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:20,056
Thank you.

1708
01:56:30,276 --> 01:56:32,528
We are to blame
for the loss of your planet,

1709
01:56:32,612 --> 01:56:35,364
and we'd be honored
to help you get it back.

1710
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:37,991
Here.

1711
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:41,913
[converter squealing]

1712
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:46,834
[speaking alien language]

1713
01:56:52,298 --> 01:56:53,299
It means, "Thank you."

1714
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:55,051
[scoffs]

1715
01:57:02,308 --> 01:57:04,143
Spread out. Spread out.

1716
01:57:30,086 --> 01:57:31,980
[General Okto-Bar] Captain,
we're locked on to you.

1717
01:57:32,004 --> 01:57:33,631
Any sign of contamination or radiation?

1718
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:35,007
Zero trace of either.

1719
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:37,802
It doesn't make any sense.

1720
01:59:10,102 --> 01:59:11,862
Didn't you say
you wanted to go to the beach?

1721
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,654
Our daughter made a good choice.

1722
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:22,573
She can rest in peace now.

1723
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,625
We must leave now.

1724
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,669
May you and your people live in peace

1725
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:37,380
wherever you may venture
in space and time.

1726
01:59:42,468 --> 01:59:43,468
[beeping]

1727
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:51,519
Explosives in place, General.
We are operational.

1728
01:59:52,395 --> 01:59:54,980
Received. Evacuate the zone.
You have four minutes.

1729
01:59:57,692 --> 01:59:58,692
Copy that.

1730
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:04,240
Father, there are hundreds of soldiers

1731
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:06,784
- all around the spaceship.
- We will be gone in a minute.

1732
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:08,762
The troops are in position,
you don't have a minute.

1733
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:10,722
You have no means of communication
with the outside world?

1734
02:00:10,746 --> 02:00:12,707
If we stop jamming signals,
we are defenseless.

1735
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:15,830
If you don't allow me to communicate
with them you'll be defenseless forever.

1736
02:00:22,383 --> 02:00:23,383
Just one call.

1737
02:00:26,721 --> 02:00:28,139
- Disarm the signal.
- Thank you!

1738
02:00:35,396 --> 02:00:38,065
The wall stopped moving.
Something's going on.

1739
02:00:38,983 --> 02:00:40,943
Maintain your position.
We're analyzing the data.

1740
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:44,256
I can't believe they'd do that.

1741
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,531
The General followed procedure.

1742
02:00:45,614 --> 02:00:46,866
Yeah, I hate procedure.

1743
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:50,262
[General Okto-Bar] <i>Captain, the data shows
that they have built some kind of vessel</i>

1744
02:00:50,286 --> 02:00:51,286
<i>beyond the wall.</i>

1745
02:00:57,209 --> 02:00:58,209
Contact with the enemy.

1746
02:01:00,254 --> 02:01:01,589
Give me a physical description.

1747
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,674
Same creatures
who kidnapped the Commander.

1748
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:11,599
They showing any signs of hostility?

1749
02:01:12,391 --> 02:01:13,391
[speaking alien language]

1750
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:16,936
Not really.

1751
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:20,399
- Are they armed?
- [Captain Kris] <i>No.</i>

1752
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:28,365
General, we're picking up a signal
from the 2005 Destiny module.

1753
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:31,118
- What?
- Sounds like Major Valerian.

1754
02:01:35,748 --> 02:01:38,018
- Patch him through.
- Major, you're on line with the General.

1755
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:39,186
- [General Okto-Bar] <i>Major?</i>
- Yeah.

1756
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:42,272
Major Valerian and Sergeant Laureline.
We're alive and on the inside of the wall.

1757
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:43,714
<i>Call off the assault immediately.</i>

1758
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:45,382
Major, I can't read your DNA codes.

1759
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:47,885
You know the procedure.
I have to be certain it's you.

1760
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:51,639
There is no time for dumbass procedures!
We are here with a whole species of people

1761
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:54,350
you've already wiped out once!
The Pearls of Planet Mül!

1762
02:01:54,433 --> 02:01:57,853
<i>So tell your men to back off
before you commit a second genocide!</i>

1763
02:01:57,937 --> 02:02:00,648
- That's definitely her temper.
- Planet Mül was uninhabited.

1764
02:02:00,731 --> 02:02:02,858
Come on. You know that's not true.

1765
02:02:02,942 --> 02:02:04,902
The Commander was there.
He gave the orders.

1766
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:08,239
And then he organized this whole procedure
to eliminate any survivors,

1767
02:02:08,948 --> 02:02:10,228
the living proof of his mistake.

1768
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,552
- Stop the procedure.
- Maybe that would explain

1769
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:14,745
why the Commander was
interrogating that creature.

1770
02:02:20,626 --> 02:02:21,666
Is the Commander with you?

1771
02:02:24,922 --> 02:02:26,131
[Valerian grunting]

1772
02:02:26,215 --> 02:02:28,217
Come on! Wakey, wakey.

1773
02:02:29,969 --> 02:02:31,428
- You've got a call.
- What?

1774
02:02:31,846 --> 02:02:32,846
[yells]

1775
02:02:33,681 --> 02:02:35,975
Let's go, my friend. Time to confess.

1776
02:02:37,393 --> 02:02:38,393
Hello?

1777
02:02:38,435 --> 02:02:41,105
No DNA code, but voice waves match.

1778
02:02:41,772 --> 02:02:44,024
This is General Okto-Bar.
Do you read me, Commander?

1779
02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:46,944
What's going on?

1780
02:02:47,695 --> 02:02:49,947
<i>We are ready to activate
the explosive device</i>

1781
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:52,616
in accordance with the orders you gave.

1782
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:55,786
Do you confirm those orders,

1783
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,330
or do you have anything to tell me,

1784
02:02:58,873 --> 02:03:01,667
<i>that would enable me
to suspend the assault?</i>

1785
02:03:06,255 --> 02:03:07,298
I am a soldier.

1786
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:14,597
A soldier will always choose
death over humiliation.

1787
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:20,853
Annihilate them all.

1788
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:27,192
[all screaming]

1789
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:33,031
[man screaming]

1790
02:03:43,626 --> 02:03:46,045
- What the hell are you doing?
- I didn't give the orders!

1791
02:03:46,378 --> 02:03:48,047
Captain, cease fire immediately!

1792
02:03:48,339 --> 02:03:50,966
It's not us, it's the K-trons.
They're shooting at us!

1793
02:03:52,927 --> 02:03:53,927
Come on, you...

1794
02:03:58,057 --> 02:04:00,297
I'm gonna go give Tsûuri some backup.
Keep an eye on him.

1795
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:03,228
- Oh, he's not going anywhere.
- [grunting]

1796
02:04:06,148 --> 02:04:07,733
Get down! Take cover!

1797
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,299
Alex, load me up with all you've got!

1798
02:04:12,363 --> 02:04:13,483
- [Alex] <i>Copy that.</i>
- Thanks.

1799
02:04:18,202 --> 02:04:19,244
[groaning]

1800
02:04:30,673 --> 02:04:33,550
- Neza, stop this countdown now!
- Yes, sir!

1801
02:04:56,407 --> 02:04:57,533
Hurry, Neza!

1802
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,604
Hurry, Neza!

1803
02:05:42,411 --> 02:05:44,872
- How much time left?
- Ten seconds!

1804
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:50,002
Hurry!

1805
02:06:10,355 --> 02:06:11,857
[panting]

1806
02:06:24,036 --> 02:06:25,036
Neza.

1807
02:06:33,545 --> 02:06:34,630
Check for survivors.

1808
02:06:42,387 --> 02:06:43,931
[panting]

1809
02:06:52,314 --> 02:06:53,314
[coughs]

1810
02:07:00,906 --> 02:07:02,074
Captain, status report?

1811
02:07:02,491 --> 02:07:04,243
Nothing's left. Just a gaping hole.

1812
02:07:05,035 --> 02:07:07,955
They left with their spaceship.
Everything's vanished.

1813
02:07:08,038 --> 02:07:10,499
And our agents? Valerian and Laureline?

1814
02:07:10,582 --> 02:07:12,459
- No, nothing.
<i>- And the Commander?</i>

1815
02:07:12,543 --> 02:07:13,943
[Commander Filitt] Is anyone there?

1816
02:07:14,086 --> 02:07:15,504
Wait, I hear something.

1817
02:07:20,134 --> 02:07:21,134
There's a body!

1818
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:24,680
Get me down from here, you children!

1819
02:07:26,557 --> 02:07:27,558
It's the Commander.

1820
02:07:28,392 --> 02:07:29,226
Is he alive?

1821
02:07:29,309 --> 02:07:31,603
Affirmative. Alive and kicking!

1822
02:07:31,687 --> 02:07:32,687
Good.

1823
02:07:36,024 --> 02:07:37,024
Arrest him.

1824
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,363
[Commander Filitt] Help!

1825
02:07:59,923 --> 02:08:01,776
[Laureline] Do you have
any idea where they left us?

1826
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,052
[Valerian] We're two hours away
from vacation.

1827
02:08:04,136 --> 02:08:05,971
I fired the distress beacons.

1828
02:08:06,054 --> 02:08:08,056
- Two hours?
- Yeah, I know.

1829
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:10,475
- Two hours alone with me, what a drag.
- Hmm.

1830
02:08:11,143 --> 02:08:13,103
No kidding. It's basically an eternity.

1831
02:08:13,187 --> 02:08:14,521
[chuckles]

1832
02:08:14,605 --> 02:08:15,605
Hey.

1833
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:20,485
Now that our mission's over
maybe we can finish our conversation.

1834
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:21,820
What conversation?

1835
02:08:21,904 --> 02:08:23,572
We were talking about the future.

1836
02:08:24,406 --> 02:08:26,825
Really? And what does the future hold?

1837
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:32,830
You.

1838
02:08:33,582 --> 02:08:34,582
Me.

1839
02:08:36,835 --> 02:08:37,835
Us.

1840
02:08:42,257 --> 02:08:43,258
Happy birthday.

1841
02:08:47,179 --> 02:08:48,597
Thank you, Valerian.

1842
02:08:50,098 --> 02:08:51,558
That is so romantic.

1843
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:53,996
Did you really think of this yourself?

1844
02:08:54,061 --> 02:08:56,897
Yeah. You mean so much to me, you know?

1845
02:08:58,649 --> 02:08:59,649
Laureline...

1846
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,946
will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

1847
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:08,033
For better or worse?

1848
02:09:09,243 --> 02:09:11,662
Uh, worse? Is that negotiable?

1849
02:09:11,954 --> 02:09:12,954
No.

1850
02:09:14,498 --> 02:09:15,498
All right, then.

1851
02:09:27,302 --> 02:09:29,763
Is that a yes?

1852
02:09:29,846 --> 02:09:31,098
It's a maybe.

1853
02:09:32,933 --> 02:09:35,018
I'm confused. Is this how love works?

1854
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:37,521
No, this is how I work.

1855
02:09:38,146 --> 02:09:40,691
You spent a day in a woman's body,
did you not learn anything?

1856
02:09:41,316 --> 02:09:42,316
Yeah.

1857
02:09:44,236 --> 02:09:45,320
I did learn something.

1858
02:09:46,363 --> 02:09:47,363
What?

1859
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:50,951
I want only your name on my playlist.
